      <p> Add some information about yourself. For now we're happy to know anything you're
      willing to share about yourself (though one thing we are curious about is your programming
      experience before bootcamp). As your progress through your degree at City you will 
      be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). However,
      even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two)
      and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: A Game similar to Agario</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
        City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates an intermediate level of the
        use of arrays, loops, and If statements and uses two classes to refactor my code
        whilst introducing interaction within my game and importing sounds.I created an 
        Agario like game in which a game in which you take charge of a tiny cell,eating 
        smaller dots.Every time you eat a dot you grow in size.   </p>
